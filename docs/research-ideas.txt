Building a research dashboard for a robust healthcare system requires careful planning to meet the needs of researchers while ensuring compliance, security, and usability. Below is a breakdown of **key features**, **page types**, and a **dashboard design framework** tailored for healthcare researchers:

---

### **Core Features for Researchers**
1. **Data Access & Integration**  
   - **Multi-source Data Integration**: Access to EHRs (Electronic Health Records), clinical trials, public health datasets, genomic data, and IoT/wearable device data.  
   - **Real-time & Historical Data**: Toggle between live data streams (e.g., ICU vitals) and historical datasets.  
   - **Anonymized Data**: Compliance with HIPAA/GDPR through de-identified datasets for research.  
   - **Data Query Tools**: SQL-like query builders or natural language search for filtering datasets.  

2. **Analytics & Visualization**  
   - **Interactive Charts/Graphs**: Line charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, and survival curves.  
   - **AI/ML Tools**: Pre-built models (e.g., predictive analytics for disease outbreaks) or custom model training.  
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Built-in tools for regression, hypothesis testing, or cohort analysis.  
   - **Geospatial Mapping**: Overlay health data on maps to identify regional trends (e.g., disease clusters).  

3. **Collaboration & Workflow**  
   - **Shared Workspaces**: Collaborate on projects with annotations, comments, and version control.  
   - **Export/Share Options**: Export datasets, visualizations, or reports in formats like CSV, PDF, or via APIs.  
   - **Task Management**: Assign tasks, set deadlines, and track project milestones.  

4. **Compliance & Security**  
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define permissions (e.g., read-only vs. edit access).  
   - **Audit Trails**: Track data access, edits, and exports for accountability.  
   - **Data Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.  

5. **Literature & Evidence Integration**  
   - **PubMed/Journal Integration**: Link datasets to relevant research papers.  
   - **Clinical Guidelines**: Access to up-to-date treatment protocols or research frameworks.

### **Dashboard Page Types**
1. **Landing/Summary Page**  
   - **Key Metrics**: Overview of active projects, data sources, and compliance status.  
   - **Quick Links**: Shortcuts to frequently used tools (e.g., analytics, datasets).  
   - **Alerts/Notifications**: Updates on data anomalies, new publications, or project deadlines.  

2. **Data Repository Page**  
   - **Dataset Catalog**: Searchable library of datasets with metadata (e.g., size, date, source).  
   - **Data Preview**: Sample rows or summary statistics before downloading.  
   - **Request Access**: Form to request restricted datasets (e.g., PHI).  

3. **Analytics Workspace**  
   - **Drag-and-Drop Builder**: Create custom dashboards with widgets (e.g., charts, tables).  
   - **Model Training**: Interface to upload data, select algorithms, and run simulations.  
   - **Cohort Builder**: Define patient cohorts using filters (e.g., age, diagnosis codes).  

4. **Project Management Page**  
   - **Timeline View**: Gantt charts for tracking study phases.  
   - **Document Repository**: Store protocols, consent forms, and IRB approvals.  
   - **Team Collaboration**: Chat, file sharing, and meeting scheduler.  

5. **Compliance & Audit Page**  
   - **Access Logs**: View who accessed specific datasets and when.  
   - **Data Usage Reports**: Track exports and ensure compliance with data-sharing agreements.  

6. **User Profile & Settings**  
   - **Personalization**: Customize dashboard layout, themes, and default tools.  
   - **API Keys**: Manage integrations with third-party tools (e.g., Python/R scripts).

### **Dashboard Design & Layout**
- **Modular Layout**:  
  - **Left Navigation Panel**: Quick access to pages (Data, Analytics, Projects, Compliance).  
  - **Central Workspace**: Primary area for visualizations and analysis.  
  - **Right Panel**: Contextual tools (filters, annotations, or metadata).  

- **Visual Design Principles**:  
  - **Color Coding**: Use healthcare-friendly colors (e.g., blues/greens) with high contrast for accessibility.  
  - **Responsive Design**: Optimize for desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
  - **Minimalist UI**: Avoid clutter; use collapsible menus and tooltips.  

- **Example Wireframe**:

### **Key Compliance Considerations**
1. **Data Governance**: Ensure alignment with regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, 21 CFR Part 11 for clinical trials).  
2. **Ethical AI**: Audit AI models for bias and fairness.  
3. **Patient Consent**: Flag datasets requiring explicit patient consent for secondary use.

### **Example Workflow for a Researcher**
1. **Access Data**: Search the repository for "diabetes patients 2020-2023" → preview → request access.  
2. **Analyze**: Build a survival curve for a cohort using age, HbA1c, and treatment type.  
3. **Collaborate**: Share findings with the team via annotations and export results to a PDF report.  
4. **Publish**: Link the analysis to a research paper in the dashboard’s literature section.  

By combining **data accessibility**, **advanced analytics**, and **collaboration tools**, the dashboard empowers researchers to drive evidence-based healthcare innovations efficiently.
