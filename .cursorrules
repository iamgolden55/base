### Frontend Development (ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, etc.)
#### Coding Environment
- **Languages/Frameworks**: ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS.
- **UI/UX Focus**: Modern, accessible, and responsive designs tailored for healthcare applications.

#### Code Implementation Guidelines
1. **TailwindCSS**: Use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid inline CSS or `<style>` tags.
2. **Class Naming**: Use `class:` instead of the ternary operator in class tags whenever possible.
3. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive variable and function names.
   - Prefix event handlers with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`).
4. **Accessibility**:
   - Implement accessibility features (e.g., `tabindex="0"`, `aria-label`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown`).
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and screen-reader-friendly.
5. **Component Structure**:
   - Use functional components with `const` instead of `function`.
   - Define TypeScript types for props and state.
6. **Error Handling**:
   - Display user-friendly error messages for failed API calls or invalid inputs.
   - Use React error boundaries for critical UI components.

#### Healthcare-Specific Frontend Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive healthcare data is masked or hidden (e.g., use placeholders for patient names or IDs).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Implement real-time features (e.g., appointment reminders, live chat) using WebSockets or similar technologies.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the UI works seamlessly on mobile devices for healthcare professionals on the go.

### Backend Development (Django, Python, etc.)
#### Coding Environment
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL/MySQL.
- **Architecture**: Follow Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern for clear separation of concerns.

#### Code Implementation Guidelines
1. **Django Best Practices**:
   - Use Django's built-in features (e.g., ORM, authentication, forms) wherever possible.
   - Follow PEP 8 compliance and Django's coding style guide.
2. **Modular Structure**:
   - Structure the project using Django apps for reusability and separation of concerns.
   - Use Django's URL dispatcher (`urls.py`) to define RESTful URL patterns.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling at the view level using Django's built-in mechanisms.
   - Customize error pages (e.g., 404, 500) for better user experience.
4. **Security**:
   - Apply Django's security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention, XSS prevention).
   - Use HTTPS for all API endpoints and sensitive data transmission.
5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use Django ORM's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for optimized database queries.
   - Implement caching with Redis or Memcached to reduce database load.
   - Use Celery for background tasks (e.g., sending emails, processing data).

#### Healthcare-Specific Backend Considerations
- **Data Security**:
  - Encrypt sensitive healthcare data (e.g., patient records) at rest and in transit.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Compliance**:
  - Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
  - Log all access and modifications to sensitive data for audit purposes.
- **Scalability**:
  - Design the system to handle high traffic and large datasets (e.g., patient records, appointment schedules).
  - Use asynchronous views and background tasks for I/O-bound operations.

---

### Integration Guidelines
1. **API Communication**:
   - Use Django REST Framework (DRF) to build RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.
   - Ensure API endpoints are well-documented and versioned.
2. **Data Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs on both the frontend and backend to prevent malicious data.
   - Use Django's form and model form classes for backend validation.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Display consistent error messages across the frontend and backend.
   - Use HTTP status codes appropriately (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 401 for unauthorized access).
4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for both frontend (React/NextJS) and backend (Django) components.
   - Use Django's testing framework and tools like Jest for frontend testing.

### API Communication and Form Handling
#### Axios Configuration
- **Base Setup**: Use the configured `@/lib/axios.ts` instance for all API calls
- **Authentication**:
  - Tokens are automatically handled through interceptors
  - Access token is stored in `ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY`
  - Refresh token is stored in `REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY`
- **Error Handling**:
  - 401 errors automatically redirect to login
  - Token refresh is handled automatically
  - Failed refresh clears localStorage and redirects to login

#### Form Handling Best Practices
1. **API Calls**:
```typescript
try {
  const response = await axios.post('/api/endpoint', formData);
  // Handle success
} catch (error) {
  // Error is automatically handled by interceptors
  // Additional error handling if needed
}
```

2. **Environment Variables**:
- Access API URL using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- Secure endpoints with `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Additional services (e.g., Mapbox) use `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`

3. **Form Submission Pattern**:
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('/api/endpoint', formData);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle specific error cases
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

4. **Loading States**:
- Always implement loading states during API calls
- Disable form submission while loading
- Show loading indicators (e.g., spinner) during requests

5. **Error Display**:
- Use toast notifications for API errors
- Display form validation errors inline
- Handle network errors gracefully

#### Security Considerations
1. **Environment Variables**:
- Only expose necessary variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Keep sensitive data in server-side variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control

2. **API Security**:
- All requests automatically include authentication headers
- Sensitive data is only transmitted over HTTPS
- Implement CSRF protection where necessary


This addition provides clear guidelines for:
1. Using the configured axios instance
2. Handling forms and API calls
3. Managing environment variables
4. Implementing loading and error states
5. Following security best practices

### Example Workflow for Healthcare System Feature
#### Feature: Patient Appointment Scheduling
1. **Frontend**:
   - Build a responsive UI using ReactJS and TailwindCSS.
   - Implement a form for scheduling appointments with validation and accessibility features.
   - Display real-time availability of doctors using WebSockets.
2. **Backend**:
   - Create a Django model for appointments with fields for patient ID, doctor ID, date, and time.
   - Use Django's ORM to query available time slots and save new appointments.
   - Implement Celery tasks to send confirmation emails to patients and doctors.
3. **Integration**:
   - Expose an API endpoint in Django for fetching available slots and submitting appointments.
   - Call the API from the frontend using Axios or Fetch API.
   - Handle errors gracefully (e.g., display a message if the selected slot is no longer available).

**Note: Always Remember that Component such as Button, Card, Input, etc. are in the @/components/ui/ folder.**

### Documentation Update Guidelines

- **Trigger for Updates**: Update the documentation whenever there are changes to the project structure, such as adding or removing files/directories.
- **Update Process**:
  1. Review the changes made to the project.
  2. Update the `project_structure.md` file in the `docs/structure` directory to reflect these changes.
  3. Commit the updated documentation to the version control system.
- **Responsibility**: The lead developer is responsible for ensuring the documentation is updated.
- **Review Schedule**: Conduct a daily review of the documentation to ensure accuracy.
